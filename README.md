## Hello! 
my name is brooke (Patrick from school) and this is Metro's FTC code for the 2025 off-season (into the deep)

if you're here then it means i probably sent/shared you this code.
if you found this by accident, please do not out me to friends/family/school

## this code uses multiple imports and other libraries 
* FTC LIB
  * adds more code
  * PID
* FTC Dashboard
  * can run code from a laptop connected to the robot via wifi
* FTControl (this is experimental as of 5/14/25)
  * should be like FTC dash but mainly for Kotlin, may or may not use
* Pedro's Pathing 
  * PP
  * mecanum auto pathing
  * unimplemented as of 5/14/25
  * plan to add it by the 2025/2026 season
  * harder setup than RR but easier usage
* Road runner
  * RR
  * motion profiling and PID
  * all implementations are commented out as of 5/14/25
  * easier setup than PP but harder usage
* Photon
  * not implemented
  * deprecated
  * should have made things faster

## slang and definitions
- commit: updates the entire project, your changed files (or the ones you select) will become the most recent official files
- PID: proportional, integral, derivative. we really only use P and D. it is a simple way to control motors.
- Telemetry: sends out real time data to driver station/Dash/FTControl
- Encoder: gets the current position of the input (motor), not the output (shaft/arm/gearbox), in one rotation of the motor there are 28 "counts" (ticks or pulses can be used as well)
- pink arm: an telescoping arm on a pivot, prime example is our FTC into the deep arm.

## rules
- I do not care that this is for school, This is my code on my account and my time and i can do what i want with it.
- If you break something, you will fix it by the next class period or time we meet, i will publicly execute you if you leave it broken.
- avoid pushing code to master the friday before comp.
- test code with the robot before THINKING about making a commit.
